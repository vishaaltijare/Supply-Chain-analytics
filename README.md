**#Inventory Management Dashboard using Power BI

Project Overview:**

Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze and manage inventory for a dataset of approximately 303 SKUs. The dashboard integrates data from Excel, performs ETL, and provides actionable insights through advanced DAX calculations and visualizations.




**Objectives:**

Track stock levels, stock movement, and reorder needs for all SKUs
Classify inventory using ABC and XYZ methods

Calculate key metrics like inventory turnover, safety stock, and weekly demand

Enable quick filtering and drill-down by product, shelf, and time period




**Key Technical Achievements:**

Imported and transformed multi-table inventory data (product, stock, order history) in Power BI

Created calculated columns and measures for weekly demand, inventory value, and reorder points using DAX

Implemented ABC/XYZ classification for SKU prioritization

Designed interactive visuals: tables, line/area charts, cards, slicers, and gauges for real-time monitoring

Built relationships between SKU and transaction tables for seamless data analysis




**Key Metrics and Insights**

303 SKUs Monitored: Real-time tracking of stock levels and movements across all products

Weekly Demand Calculation: Average weekly sales derived from 12 months of transaction data

Inventory Turnover Ratio: COGS over average stock value, highlighting efficiency of stock usage

Safety Stock & Reorder Points: Buffer and trigger levels computed to prevent stockouts

ABC/XYZ Classification: Priority segmentation (A/B/C and X/Y/Z) to focus on high-value and high-variability items

Bottom 10 SKUs Analysis: Identifies the lowest on-hand stock items for immediate replenishment




**My Key Learnings:**

Advanced DAX for inventory analytics and time-based calculations

Data modeling and ETL best practices in Power BI

Practical application of inventory management concepts (ABC/XYZ, turnover, safety stock)

Dashboard design for operational decision support

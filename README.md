**__Inventory Management Dashboard using Power BI__**

**__Project Overview:__**  
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to manage inventory for 303 SKUs over 12 months. It consolidates Excel data, performs ETL, and leverages DAX measures and visuals to deliver real-time insights on stock levels, value, and movement.

**__Objectives:__**  
Track real-time stock and transactions for 303 SKUs, apply ABC (70/20/10) and XYZ classifications, compute weekly demand (12-month data), inventory turnover, safety stock, and reorder points, and enable drill-down by SKU, shelf, and date.

**__Key Technical Achievements:__**  
Imported and modeled three Excel tables (303 SKUs), built DAX measures for weekly demand, stock value, turnover, safety stock, and reorder points, implemented ABC/XYZ segmentation (7 A-SKUs, 10 B-SKUs, 33 C-SKUs), and designed seven interactive visuals (cards, Pareto chart, line chart, table, slicers, gauges).

**__Key Metrics and Insights:__**  
- 303 SKUs monitored in real time  
- Weekly demand derived from 12 months of sales  
- Inventory turnover ratio (COGS รท avg. stock value)  
- Safety stock and reorder point calculations preventing stockouts  
- ABC/XYZ segmentation for SKU prioritization  
- Bottom-10 SKUs report for urgent replenishment

**__My Key Learnings:__**  
Mastered advanced DAX (SUMX, DIVIDE, SWITCH), Power BI ETL and data modeling, applied ABC/XYZ, turnover, and safety stock concepts, and designed an operations-ready dashboard for supply-chain decision support.

Inventory Management Dashboard using Power BI


**Project Overview:**

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to manage inventory for 303 SKUs over 12 months. It consolidates Excel data, performs ETL, and leverages DAX measures and visuals to deliver real-time insights on stock levels, value, and movement.

**Objectives:**

Track real-time stock and transactions for 303 SKUs, apply ABC (70/20/10) and XYZ classifications, compute weekly demand (12-month data), inventory turnover, safety stock, and reorder points, and enable drill-down by SKU, shelf, and date.



**Key Technical Achievements:**

Imported and modeled three Excel tables (303 SKUs), built DAX measures for weekly demand, stock value, turnover, safety stock, and reorder points, implemented ABC/XYZ segmentation (7 A-SKUs, 10 B-SKUs, 33 C-SKUs), and designed seven interactive visuals (cards, Pareto chart, line chart, table, slicers, gauges).





**Key Metrics and Insights:**

303 SKUs monitored in real time

Weekly demand derived from 12 months of sales

Inventory turnover ratio (COGS รท avg. stock value)

Safety stock and reorder point calculations preventing stockouts

ABC/XYZ segmentation for SKU prioritization

Bottom-10 SKUs report for urgent replenishment

**My Key Learnings:**

Mastered advanced DAX (SUMX, DIVIDE, SWITCH), Power BI ETL and data modeling, applied ABC/XYZ, turnover, and safety stock concepts, and designed an operations-ready dashboard for supply-chain decision support.
